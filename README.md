# ViA Cryptography Course Work
As a part of the Introduction to Cryptography course at Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences, third course students developed an encryption/decryption program to learn AES and DES encryption standards.
AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. DES stands for Data Encryption Standard. Both DES and AES are symmetric-key block ciphers that are used in encryption where just one key (the secret key) is utilized to encode and decode electronic data.
